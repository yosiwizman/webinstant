## 📈 Current State Score: 65/100

The project has a **solid foundation** with core AI generation working well. Main gaps are in the business/payment layer that connects the generation to actual customer delivery. With 1-2 weeks of focused development on the critical fixes, this could be production-ready.

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

WebInstant is a **clever and well-conceived project** with strong technical implementation of the core value proposition (AI-powered instant websites). The main work needed is connecting the payment and deployment automation to turn generated previews into live customer websites. The $150 price point and 24-hour delivery promise are achievable with the current architecture once the missing pieces are implemented.
